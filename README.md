Do you love the thrilling, action-packed excitement?
Do you live every day at mach 1 on the razor's edge of death-defying energy?
Do all your friends keep telling you to stop re-organizing your cards because it's been your turn for 20 minutes?

Then you might just be bold enough for the MOLE MONGER: An organizational tool for the Underground Duchy faction in Root: A game of woodland Might and Right.

Feel the adrenaline rush as you politely lobby one of nine members of parliament with left click, and watch in amazement as both moles and crowns light up in GLORIOUS 2D COLOUR.
Click again and marvel as those same moles metaphorically explode back to their sad, desaturated lives.

YOU'LL PAY FOR THE WHOLE PARLIAMENT, BUT YOU'LL ONLY USE THE EDGE.

USAGE:
From the "games" menu, click the three-dots icon on this mod, and select "Additive load".

You can use my project outside of Root, but I don't know why you would.
